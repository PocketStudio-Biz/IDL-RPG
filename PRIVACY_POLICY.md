# Privacy Policy for IDL RPG

**Last Updated**: [Date]

## Introduction

IDL RPG ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our mobile application ("App").

## Information We Collect

### No Personal Information Required
IDL RPG does not require you to create an account or provide any personal information to use the App. You can enjoy all features of the game without providing any personal data.

### Local Data Storage
The App stores game progress and settings locally on your device using:
- **UserDefaults**: For game settings and preferences
- **CoreData** (if implemented): For game state and progression data

This data remains on your device and is never transmitted to our servers or third parties.

### Automatically Collected Information
The App may collect the following information automatically:
- **Device Information**: Device type, operating system version (for compatibility purposes)
- **App Usage**: Game progress, achievements, and gameplay statistics (stored locally only)

**Note**: This information is stored locally on your device and is not shared with us or any third parties.

## How We Use Information

Since we do not collect personal information or transmit data to external servers, we do not use your information in any way. All game data remains on your device.

## Data Sharing

**We do not share, sell, or transmit any data to third parties.** All game data is stored locally on your device.

## Third-Party Services

Currently, IDL RPG does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or data collection services. If we add such services in the future, we will update this Privacy Policy accordingly.

## Data Security

Since all data is stored locally on your device, data security is primarily managed by your device's operating system security features. We recommend:
- Keeping your device's operating system updated
- Using device passcodes or biometric authentication
- Backing up your device regularly (game progress may be included in device backups)

## Children's Privacy

IDL RPG is suitable for users of all ages. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. Since we do not collect any personal information, this is not applicable, but we are committed to protecting children's privacy.

## Your Rights

Since all data is stored locally on your device, you have full control over your data:
- **Delete Data**: You can delete the App at any time, which will remove all local game data
- **No Account Required**: You are not required to create an account, so there is no account data to manage
- **Local Control**: All game data is stored on your device and can be managed through your device settings

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by:
- Posting the new Privacy Policy in the App
- Updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy

You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
